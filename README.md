## For mission designers
Situation is as follows: 
Situation
On 1st May 2011 the Russian forces conducted a full scale invasion of SOUTH OSSETIA. This surprise attack took the Georgian forces by surprise and SOUTH OSSETIA was under Russian control within the first week of the conflict. After consolidation on their position in SOUTH OSSETIA, Russia have now started an offensive in order to take the capital of Lochini. In addition to this offensive, the Russian forces have recently also started pushing WEST from SOUTH OSSETIA, at the same time as Russian forces are mobilizing on the border to ABKHAZIA.
In ABKHAZIA, a rebel group that are linked with Russia have increased their activity. They have conducted several terror attacks on Georgian official buildings. There have also been attacks at Georgian official vehicles in ABKHAZIA. Reporting indicates that the rebel group are reciving supplies from Russia. It is assessed as likely that this increase of terror and rebel activity in ABKHAZIA is an attempt from RUSSIA to undermine the GEORGIAN authorities and create an excuse for RUSSIAN forces to enter the province, in order to secure the Russian citizens living in ABKHAZIA.
The current assessment is that Russia is preparing a full scale attack on ABKHAZIA and the Russian attack on SOUTH OSSETIA was just the first step in the Russian strategic goal of occupying GEORGIA.
Georgia reached out to its friends and allies and while ground forces are slowly moving toward the conflictzone with ships, air assets have arrived in country and are helpng the local Georgian forces to slow down and take up the fight with the Russian invasion forces.
The primary allied bases in the area are now KUTASISI, KOBULET, SENAKI and BATUMI.

For designing the local situation and taskings: EAST of KUTAISI/SENAKI=WAR ,  WEST of KUTAISI/SENAKI= Insurgent activity , this will give increased flexibility and different taskings in the two different areas.
